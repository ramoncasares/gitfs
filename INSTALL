In its current form, gitfs will probably require some tweaking to get it to
compile.  If you're not comfortable doing this then gitfs is probably not
ready for you yet.

Prerequisites:

  * FUSE  --  http://fuse.sourceforge.net/

    I'm currently using version 2.3.0.  I'm not sure if earlier versions will
    work or not.

    You also need to be running a kernel with FUSE filesystem support compiled
    in.  Probably the easiest way to do this is just run a recent -mm
    kernel -- I'm using 2.6.12-rc5-mm2 on my test machine currently.  The
    fuse package also provides a method for patching a non -mm kernel, but
    I haven't tried that.

  * GIT

    Personally, I'm still using the git-20050526 snapshot that Jeff Garzik
    made last month.  Hopefully it will work against a more recent git
    still, but maybe some tweaking will be needed.  Updating to a more
    current git tree is high on my TODO list.

    Since we link against libgit.a you'll need to have the compiled source
    tree sitting around to build gitfs.

Next, edit the first few lines of Makefile to suit:

 GITCFLAGS, GITLDFLAGS -- flags required to compile and link against git

  FUSECFLAGS, FUSELDFLAGS -- flags required to compile and link against fuse.
    Hopefully if you did a "make install" the fuse files should be installed
    into /usr/local already and you won't need to change these

Finally, just do a "make" and you should have a working gitfs binary.  Good
luck.
