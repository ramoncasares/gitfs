In its current form, gitfs will probably require some tweaking to get it to
compile.  If you're not comfortable doing this then gitfs is probably not
ready for you yet.

Prerequisites:

  * FUSE  --  http://fuse.sourceforge.net/

    I'm currently using version 2.3.0.  I'm not sure if earlier versions will
    work or not.

    You also need to be running a kernel with FUSE filesystem support compiled
    in -- very recent mainline kernels now support this (CONFIG_FUSE_FS)

  * GIT  --  http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/

    Currently tested with git-core-0.99.8.  Since we link against libgit.a
    you'll need to have the compiled source tree sitting around to build gitfs.

Next, edit the first few lines of Makefile to suit:

 GITDIR, GITCFLAGS, GITLDFLAGS -- flags required to compile and link against
    git.  Probably you'll just need to point GITDIR at the directory your
    git tools were built at (including libgit.a and cache.h)

 FUSECFLAGS, FUSELDFLAGS -- flags required to compile and link against fuse.
    Hopefully if you did a "make install" the fuse files should be installed
    into /usr/local already and you won't need to change these

Finally, just do a "make" and you should have a working gitfs binary.  Good
luck.
