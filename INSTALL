In its current form, gitfs will probably require some tweaking to get it to
compile.  If you're not comfortable doing this then gitfs is probably not
ready for you yet.

Prerequisites:

  * FUSE  --  http://fuse.sourceforge.net/

    gitfs doesn't actually need the FUSE library but you still at least
    need FUSE's "fusermount" helper program installed somewhere in your $PATH

    You also need to be running a kernel with FUSE filesystem support compiled
    in -- very recent mainline kernels now support this (CONFIG_FUSE_FS)

  * GIT  --  http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/

    Currently tested with git-1-4.4.  Since we link against libgit.a
    you'll need to have the compiled source tree sitting around to build gitfs.

Next, edit the first few lines of Makefile to suit:

 GITDIR, GITCFLAGS, GITLDFLAGS -- flags required to compile and link against
    git.  Probably you'll just need to point GITDIR at the directory your
    git tools were built at (including libgit.a and cache.h)

 FUSECFLAGS -- flags required to compile against fuse.  Just set FUSE_HEADER
    to point at a copy of the <linux/fuse.h> header from a recent 2.6 kernel

Finally, just do a "make" and you should have a working gitfs binary.  Good
luck.
